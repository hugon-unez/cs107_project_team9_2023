Paul Alexis Self-Eval:
I spent approximately a total of 20 hours on the project. The bulk of this was dedicated to figuring things out as opposed to actually writing the code. My main contributions to the project include the initial api mapping, the data-preprocessing module, the unit tests for the preprocessing module, the crossmatch module and description of the execution of our first package. As a less experienced coder on the team, I was given a bit of runway to work on the modules, which may have led to spending more time on modules than someone with more experience would have done. It also meant that some of my initial work had to be tweaked by the team.
